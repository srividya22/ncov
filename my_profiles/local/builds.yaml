# This is where we define which builds we'd like to run.
# This example includes one minimal global build.

# Each build needs a name, a defined subsampling process, and geographic attributes used for subsampling.
# Geography is specified by build attributes (e.g., `region`, `country`, `division`, `location`) that are referenced from subsampling schemes.

# The default config file, `./defaults/parameters.yaml` has reasonable default subsampling methods for each geographic resolution.
# These subsample primarily from the area of interest ("focus"), and add in background ("contextual") sequences from the rest of the world.
# Contextual sequences that are genetically similar to (hamming distance) and geographically near the focal sequences are heavily prioritized.

# In this example, we use these default methods. See other templates for examples of how to customize this subsampling scheme.
builds:
  # This build focuses on all of North America
  # with a build name that will produce the following URL fragment on Nextstrain/auspice:
  # /ncov/north-america
  north-america_custom:
    subsampling_scheme: region
    region: North America

  # This build samples evenly from the globe
  # with a build name that will produce the following URL fragment on Nextstrain/auspice:
  # /ncov/global
  #global:
  #  subsampling_scheme: region_global
  #  region: global

# Define custom subsampling logic for county-level builds.
